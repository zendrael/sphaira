# Sphaira

Sphaira is programming language / interpreter that I made on 2007 as my Conclusion Work for College.

The aim of this language is to write apps that could run on Desktop with HTML user interfaces. (Only tested on Linux at that time). There is the Sphaira interpreter and the htgui (Hyper Text Graphical User Interface) that makes the calls to the interpreter each time a new form must be loaded as HTML.

As I am fully working in web and game development, this code will stay here for future reference when I could play again with compilers and interpreters.
